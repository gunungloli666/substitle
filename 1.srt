Nice suit.

00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,759
You two guys haven't met?

00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,633
This here's Park Young-jun.

37
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,108
He's the blue chip in the
business right now.

38
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,178
- VP of Mano Development, conceptualizing...
- That'll do. Let's not go into details.

39
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,679
- Nice meeting you.
- He's a detailed guy, you know.

40
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,582
Min-jae here.
I'm the blue chip of his life.

41
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,750
- You call that a joke?
- Can I sit over there?

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,452
Yeah, the sofa's all yours.

43
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,283
Hold on.

44
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,023
Oh, and this lady here
has supervised all the lighting in here.

45
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,752
She's Young-jun's wife.

46
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,483
I'm So-yeo.

47
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,930
l'm Min-jae.

48
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,797
Hey, Mi-sun.

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,301
Hi, guys.

50
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,034
- Hey, Mi-sun.
- Yeah?

51
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,175
You look breathless today.

52
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,243
It's not the first time, you know.

53
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,240
Isn't the lighting
perfect in here?

54
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,082
Doesn't So-yeo look
prettier today?

55
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,146
She's always the same.

56
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,956
Wow- congratulation.

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,324
My god!

58
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,315
This place looks great!

59
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,694
Hi, guys.

60
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,463
Hello, long time no see.
Where are these guys anyway?

61
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,021
Over here.

62
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,967
Why are you saying hi to
people you don't know?

63
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,130
Congratulation! Congratulation!

64
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,073
You've finally
become a bar owner!

65
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,634
10 years of buying drinks
for you is over. Payback time!

66
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,213
Of course! Two visits a week
guaranteed. Okay?

67
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,908
Yeah, but no credits.

68
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,788
I'm so happy for you.
This is really great!

69
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,622
- Hi hon.
- You're late.

70
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,790
Oh dear.

71
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,993
Everyone, sit, sit.
That was a noisy entrance.

72
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,484
I couldn't help but notice this fella.
He's my husband.

73
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,954
Oh, hello.

74
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,301
This place is gorgeous.

75
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,132
- Looks great, huh?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,969
Sir!

77
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,641
- Hey there.
- Come on in.

78
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,943
Hello, sir. You didn't have
trouble with the traffic?

79
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,978
- Yeah, it was fine.
- You didn't bring you wife?

80
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,775
Why bother.

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,404
Hey, Young-jun.

82
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,742
Have you two acquainted?

83
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,555
i told you about her.

84
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,192
She's Seo Yu-na, and she'll
provide you the VlP service.

85
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,093
The best we have
in our department.

86
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,664
Thank you.

87
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,060
I thought you had
a leg problem.

88
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,076
You must be feeling the weight on your
shoulders with such an important role.

89
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,840
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Seo Yu-na.

90
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,683
No need to feel pressured.

91
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,019
With so much work, you won't have
time for shopping.

92
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,987
Your wife's pretty busy too.

93
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,692
i can't wear what others
choose for me. You know that.

94
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,927
That's precisely
why you need her.

95
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,431
Who would think you're the owner
of Mano Development?

96
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,368
People have to get suited to
their standards.

97
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,805
I've put you on the VlP list.
You'll be in good hands.

98
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,238
I'll do my best.

99
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,306
Hey, Min-jae.
You should be able to help So-yeo.

100
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm sorry?

101
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
I heard about your
business trip to Hong Kong.

102
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,889
It's high season,
and there won't be any rooms left.

103
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,691
- You have one of your chain hotels there, right?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,460
It's okay.
She won't need that.

105
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,929
Hey, where's the love?
It's all about helping out, you know.

106
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,760
Go on, you should help her.

107
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,566
This'll pay you back.

108
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,362
Oh.

109
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,138
You owe her a favor?

110
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,231
No, what l meant was...

111
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,373
What's this about?

112
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,367
Hey, that tastes great.

113
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,877
You two sure work like a couple.

114
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,384
Don't bother.

115
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,147
Hey, we're not regular guests.

116
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,883
-Trying to sneak out without paying, huh?
- That's called teamwork.

117
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,984
Hush, everyone.

118
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,589
So-yeo, does this guy get
any sleep at all?

119
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,169
He's always like this
at gatherings.

120
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,006
I knew it. So what should
we do about this?

121
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,735
- What are you doing?
- There he goes again.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,808
Don't!

123
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,704
- It didn't go in.
- It didn't?

124
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,066
The fruits look nice.

125
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:27,571
Didn't that couple look
great together?

126
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,274
I envy them.

127
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,876
Envy them?

128
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,878
It must be herjob.
She has her husband well-dressed.

129
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,413
Yeah, it's herjob...

130
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,581
...to bother other
people with what they wear.

131
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,986
Where's my passport...

132
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,228
Now that you're back,
it's my turn to go.

133
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,099
When will we...

134
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,935
Time for a foot massage!

135
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:10,481
lt's time for my lovely wife
to get a foot massage.

136
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,614
Don't do that with
people around you.

137
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,018
Do what?

138
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,925
You can be a little
more stuck-up, you know.

139
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,630
Like Park Young-jun?

140
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,157
Exactly.

141
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,630
Did that look good to you?

142
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,139
That was more rude than anything.

143
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,073
I got a cast on my neck!

144
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,517
i pity her wife.

145
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,218
You pity her?

146
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,286
Didn't she look a little gloomy?

147
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,486
You sure had your eyes on her.

148
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,030
So you want to help her?

149
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,633
You don't have to get all snappy.
You wouldn't call that help.

150
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,674
i mean...
what is there to pity her?

151
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,444
You've heard about her husband, right?
Number 2 at Mano Development.

152
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,741
Number 2!

153
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,949
When have you been number two
in you life, huh?

154
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,085
How come your feet becomes
more beautiful with age?

155
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:24,156
And her side of the family owns
the nation's largest light bulb company.

156
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,559
So she's got a rich husband,
and comes from a rich family

157
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,363
plus she's a lighting designer with
her own shop at such an early age.

158
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,433
So what part do you pity
about her, huh?

159
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,003
Right, right!
So I'm wrong about that part.

160
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,598
Damn, l'm tired.
I think l'm getting old.

161
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,509
Are you just a nice guy,
or is itjust being naive?

162
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,171
Aren't you envious at all?

163
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,109
There you go, getting all snappy again.
Why should I be envious?

164
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,516
Hey, that's precisely why we're in this
miserable state, you know?

165
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,126
Oh, come on.
What's wrong with us?

166
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,718
I quit.

167
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,619
Hey.

168
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,338
We won't see each other

169
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,069
when i go on the business trip.

170
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,235
Let go.

171
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:27,081
Oh, come on Yu-na.

172
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,550
Hey, Yu-na.

173
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,550
You're getting less allowance from now on.
End of the conversation!

174
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,597
Hey, how can you do this to me?

175
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,100
You know how tight my budget is.

176
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,127
You're not the only one.
I wear sample wardrobe, remember?

177
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:51,101
We're not doing that badly.
Right?

178
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,711
Oh, let go. You're tickling me!

179
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,243
Okay, okay. Deal!

180
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:04,152
But you've got to fancy me.

181
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,361
Oh, be real.
What is there to fancy you about?

182
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,692
Damn it.

183
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,459
I'm good looking.

184
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,028
And I'm good at bed!

185
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,599
Let's see you get to work, tiger!

186
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,739
Bonsoir- So-yeo!
Beautiful So-yeo.

187
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,276
This is shop access card and
the address and the password here.

188
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,811
Thank you very much.

189
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,180
Are you sure you want to check
the light tonight again?

190
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,016
Of course, it's my job. I wanna
make sure everything works fine.

191
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,313
Magnifique!

192
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,594
Have Kim come up here.

193
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,604
She's been waiting for a long time.
It's not her first time here, either.

194
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,438
Hello.

195
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,599
Oh. Come on in, then.

196
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,470
Tell Kim to come up
10 minutes later.

197
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:41,687
i would say you enjoy wearing
a mix-and-match style.

198
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:46,425
You wear a tie, but with a
leather blouson instead of a jacket.

199
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,953
Or a suit with a shirt
but with no tie.

200
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,101
An unbalanced look suits well
with your personality.

201
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,606
But does not give you the
image of a CEO.

202
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,632
I don't wish to advertise
myself as a CEO.

203
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,411
I'm not talking about a style
that's too edgy,

204
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,314
as if you've just come down
from the catwalk.

205
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,384
Suits today come in a lot of
different patterns,

206
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,615
from active to traditional.

207
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,725
A man named Alexander Eckhart
once said,

208
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,994
'There are two types
of men in this world,

209
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,998
Those thatjust wear a suit,
and those that wear them the right way.'

210
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,200
You should start wearing suits
the right way,

211
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,668
with that classic...

212
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,568
Let's go with this, this,
and this.

213
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,863
30 inch waist,
100 for the chest,

214
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,669
38 and 'large',
American size.

215
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,379
Is Kim waiting right now?

216
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,180
Yes, sir.

217
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,171
Tell him to come up here.

218
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,155
We wouldn't lose face in front of
director Kang

219
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,453
if I buy two ltalian suits.

220
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,931
I'm not here to just sell
a couple of suits.

221
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,469
Consider myself
your fashion consultant.

222
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,997
So, I need to buy more suits?

223
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,806
No, that's not what I mean.

224
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,746
There's a briefcase
that I'd like to recommend.

225
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,813
All right then.

226
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:19,182
Send along the briefcase.
Something not too boring, though.

227
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,754
Okay.

228
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,253
Thank you for your time.

229
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,130
Let me know if
you need anything else.

230
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,903
When do you want your suit?

231
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,929
Whenever you feel convenient.
l'm not in a hurry.

232
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,465
Right.

233
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,646
You can find your way out, right?

234
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,381
Too much work on my shoulders,
you know.

235
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,654
That young son of a bitch!

236
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
You're from a good breed, huh?

237
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,672
Please consider our proposal.
It will be great for you, great for me.

238
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,071
OK, sure...

239
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,107
Tomorrow will be another long day.

240
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,302
I'm ok! I'm a tough guy.

241
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:02,921
Excuse me just a moment...

242
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,218
Oh yeah, no problem...

243
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,092
Why do l need a reason to
have a drink?

244
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,466
You can't fool me, girl.
You're in a bad mood tonight.

245
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,900
I am not.

246
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,741
Give me another shot!

247
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,577
Wow. This guy must really be someone
to make you feel this mad.

248
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:37,890
He's not worth a crap.

249
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,884
There you go again.
Who is this fella?

250
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,064
Your pal.

251
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,259
My pal? Which pal?

252
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,399
Young-jun?

253
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,073
Let's not talk about this.
Oh, we meet again!

254
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,301
Hey, you...

255
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,410
What brings you here Young-jun?
Never heard you were coming.

256
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,846
One of my appointments
were cancelled,

257
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,076
so I thought I'd drop by
for a drink.

258
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,918
That's great! We were getting
a little bored, the two of us.

259
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,216
Take a seat! Let's drink!

260
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,446
Uh, come sit over here...

261
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,424
I'll be at the bar.
Talk to you later.

262
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,827
No, no, no.

263
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,029
Drink with us, come on!

264
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,831
I'm interrupting
your conversation.

265
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,389
No, really! We were bored.

266
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,701
Hey, join us.
Don't be so shy.

267
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,828
You've all been acquainted,
let's drink.

268
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,538
We were getting so bored.

269
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,301
Sit. Have a drink.

270
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,402
Come on, sit over here.

271
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,773
That was close...

272
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,080
Chul-ju, let's drink some wine.

273
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,377
Alright.

274
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,188
This is a dish made
from a fish called Garupa.

275
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:51,262
This fella here looks
just like my boss.

276
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,065
And this is the Mantis shrimp,
very sweet flesh.

277
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,161
We're even with this treat,
you know.

278
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:03,007
Could I ask you another favor?

279
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,105
Sure! What can I do for you?

280
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,949
I have to check on the lights

281
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,940
but I don't know my way
around here.

282
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,883
Can I have a look at that?

283
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,857
- I have no idea where this is.
- I think... it's over that side.

284
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:36,872
You would look good on a
very formal suit, you know.

285
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:42,907
Why don't you try a classic London
Savile Row-style tailored suit?

286
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,984
You would look awesome in that.

287
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:54,126
While dress shirt matched
with a silk tie,

288
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,461
and a navy color two-button suit or...

289
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,931
A three-button suit

290
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,701
would be a safer choice,
if you're looking to succeed in business!

291
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,193
Perfect.
One hundred percent!

292
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:12,469
Does everyone in your business
talk like that?

293
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,843
Huh?

294
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,241
You seem to mix in
English all the time.

295
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,621
It sounds pretty retarded when
you use English like that on a sentence.

296
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,145
Don't you think?

297
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:32,956
Well... Most trend-setting
nations do speak English.

298
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,123
So it is hard to find the
right expression in Korean.

299
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,040
So if i want to
buy something from you,

300
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,601
I'll have to make a 'reservation'
with a 'phone call', right?

301
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,744
Do you have meals every now and
then with your 'clients'?

302
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,450
Oh, in you business...

303
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,619
You would call it 'lunch'.

304
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,917
You would do 'business'

305
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,454
and share 'love'.

306
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,892
You're right.

307
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:11,127
But the next stage
is the same for every business.

308
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,768
Next stage?

309
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:19,772
Yeah, the stage after 'love'.
'Sex'!

310
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,703
People in your business do that, right?

311
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:29,354
To think of it, you guys
at the construction business

312
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:33,313
would be involved in an intercourse
than have sex, right?

313
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:38,063
Hey, what's this about sex?
There's an air of lewdness here

314
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,826
that I haven't sensed before.

315
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,901
I'll leave you guys to talk.

316
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,566
No, you would actually 'copulate'.

317
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,911
But we folks using English
in between have 'sex'

318
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,711
or 'fuck'!

319
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,418
Leaving already?

320
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,990
Should be the next block ahead.

321
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,101
What did you say to
piss her off like that?

322
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,137
Nothing much.

323
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,635
You toyed with her
in the afternoon too?

324
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,077
Toy her? She's no toy,
you know.

325
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:34,152
Yu-na looks confident
but she is having a hard time.

326
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,847
Give her a break!

327
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,859
She supports both Min-jae
and her family,

328
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,226
and her sister got swindled
in marriage.

329
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,264
Be nice to her.
She's not a stranger.

330
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,629
Don't want to hear about it.

331
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,859
Oh...

332
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:56,139
You want someone to drive you home?
Or do you want to take a cab?

333
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,413
Give her a break, man.
Look at her!

334
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,900
Shit, it's cold.

335
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,796
Yu-na.

336
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,666
SEO Yu-na!

337
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,841
What do you think you're doing?

338
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,274
Let go!

339
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,880
Or you drunk or are you mad?

340
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,472
It's something expensive!

341
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,311
And it's not mine.

342
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,560
A little rain won't harm anything.
I'll buy it off you.

343
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,388
Have you been such
an ass all along?

344
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,628
Let's finish the conversation.

345
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,732
Finish what? Do you want to
get beat by a girl?

346
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,177
I buy a suit off you
and you want to beat

347
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,578
that client, huh? All right!

348
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,947
Huh? Hey!

349
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,780
Pretty, isn't it?

350
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,093
It's still a prison to the birds.

351
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,661
But doesn't that look sincere?

352
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,101
Trying to keep a bird
that one loves, and

353
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,876
at least trying to keep the bird
in a pretty cage.

354
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,010
So... let's put it this way.

355
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,750
I'd like to be beat with the
prettiest lash if I'm being tortured.

356
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,311
Or be stuck with a golden spear.
If I'm to die.

357
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,224
Let's find the shoe store first.

358
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,317
We can come back here tomorrow.

359
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,588
Not tomorrow.
I'm leaving on a morning flight.

360
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,457
Too bad.

361
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,600
Are you always this
quick in giving up?

362
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,137
But there's no other solution!

363
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,230
What if I come up with one?

364
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,503
You don't believe in me?

365
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,637
What are doing?

366
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,979
Min-jae!

367
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,353
it's okay.
No one's going to look anyway.

368
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,659
Don't be a fool.

369
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,253
I'm going for it.

370
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,599
What do you think you're doing?

371
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,625
Ha, fooled you.
It's over here.

372
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:17,142
Enough with fooling around.
I'll get you a cage.

373
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,133
You can't fool me twice.

374
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,845
This time it's for real.

375
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,278
Go ahead.

376
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,207
All right, you said it.

377
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,714
Here goes.

378
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,291
Can't stop it now.

379
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,600
What have you done?

380
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,168
Sorry, sorry sir...

381
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,936
i'm calling the police!

382
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,427
I'm sorry.
That wasn't on purpose.

383
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,638
So-yeo,

384
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,542
run!

385
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,373
No, no, this way!

386
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,697
What's wrong?

387
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,333
Take one step at a time.

388
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,238
We didn't even break the window,
what's with him?

389
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,466
My sentiments exactly.

390
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,640
- Here.
- Right...

391
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,751
How's your ankle?
Did you sprain it?

392
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,449
Yeah... it's okay.

393
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,520
You sure?

394
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,895
Yeah. See?

395
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,208
He's still following us!

396
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,971
What?

397
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,709
Don't leave me behind!

398
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,507
So-yeo. No one's following us.

399
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,081
So-yeo, it's a lie!

400
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,575
What are we here for?

401
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,607
You said you wanted to beat me up.

402
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,854
Let's see who beats up who.

403
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,357
Feel free to come up here.

404
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,985
We, at Fight Club,

405
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,796
will take full responsibility.

406
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,532
Come up and relieve your stress,

407
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:58,263
and you'll be eligible
for lots of prizes.

408
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,406
As the ring announcer,

409
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,434
I will give you one last chance...

410
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,716
For the first time ever,

411
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,708
a beautiful lady is
approaching the ring.

412
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,787
Man, you guys are lucky tonight!

413
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,549
Welcome!

414
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,855
This way, ma'am.

415
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,266
Standing at 5'7'',
with a bodacious bodyline.

416
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,134
The Jean D'arc of mixed martial arts...

417
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,807
And it looks like
she's pointing at someone...

418
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,640
This guy's a loser if he doesn't
stand to the challenge.

419
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:43,641
i'd love to get beat
by this beauty here.

420
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:51,983
Come on! Loser!

421
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,823
Well, what do you know.
Here's our man stepping in!

422
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm not letting you off
because you're a girl.

423
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,865
Beat me and talk trash.

424
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,204
All right. Fight!

425
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,475
Fight me, you chicken!

426
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,819
Did you just hit me?

427
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,192
Hey, it's a full moon.

428
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:17,875
So-yeo, have you ever
experienced this? You know...

429
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,348
What did l think of that night,
to do such a crazy thing?

430
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:28,376
During those nights,
there always seems to be a full moon.

431
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,523
That's mean of them.

432
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,626
Why make an excuse on a full moon?

433
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,527
So-yeo,

434
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:44,992
have you ever had a date with
a man other than your husband,

435
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,230
at a place you've come
for the first time?

436
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,475
No.

437
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,468
You see, that would be
an unusual event.

438
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:59,811
You look up the sky, and...
there you have it.

439
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,819
Is that for real?

440
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,621
- So-yeo.
- Yeah?

441
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,394
You look better with your hair down.

442
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,040
Wow.

443
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,174
Sorry. l've got to check on the lights,
because the shop opens tomorrow.

444
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,722
i know this singer.

445
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,555
You do?

446
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,799
The guy who sang the song...

447
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:27,465
His friend's brother's roommate
was close with...

448
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,704
My mother's secret boyfriend.

449
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,415
Hold on.
His friend's brother's...

450
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,086
Whoa, that's a real destiny.

451
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,385
Do you know that
when a woman has a secret...

452
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,563
she's bound to tell
that to one certain person?

453
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,803
You shouldn't tell our secret.

454
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:06,270
Our secret? What secret?

455
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,308
We almost broke someone's window.

456
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,816
That's a little lame for a secret.

457
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,483
Huh?

458
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,312
One shot!

459
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,845
Come on, spit it out.
What is your problem?

460
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,888
There's something you've
got figured all wrong.

461
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,094
Figured all wrong?

462
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:34,656
So I was hoping to
teach you what's right.

463
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,825
Ha. Teach me?

464
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,903
A while ago you've mentioned...

465
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,777
That it's sex after datingfor everyone.

466
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,348
You're wrong.
We have sex first.

467
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,249
Then we decide whether
we'll date or not.

468
00:35:53,417 --> 00:36:00,550
Sex is just sex.
There's no need to date.

469
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,221
Treating something,
buying flowers...

470
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,994
You do that to take a girl into bed.

471
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,894
You've got that right.

472
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,338
Are you hitting on me?

473
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,828
lf i am...

474
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,233
Will you fall for it?

475
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:32,453
What would l do
with a kid like you?

476
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:40,054
It says it all in your face.
I FEEL DESPERATE.

477
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,834
Good night.
Have a safe trip back to Seoul.

478
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,054
Where would you people
have sex without us

479
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,551
in the construction business?

480
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,566
We make that possible
because we provide the space

481
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,033
Don't you think?

482
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:38,112
So you'll build hotels naked

483
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,510
without us?

484
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:49,522
Let's see you do it.
With your thing bouncing up and down.

485
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,704
Don't bother me after
you've had a taste of me.

486
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:16,651
We do it full time,
with 45 minute halves.

487
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,522
Soccer?
Ha. We do a marathon.

488
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,867
We start

489
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:47,179
when the marathon starts,

490
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,883
all the way till the last guy
crosses the finish line.

491
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,426
No breaks in between.
Did you know that?

492
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,003
Bad killer instincts
and shooting touch...

493
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,733
If that's how bad you are,
don't even try playing the match.

494
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,303
Fair play!

495
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,779
If you're into having
all the fun for yourself,

496
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,872
you won't leave this place alive.
Understand?

497
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,779
Fair play?
That's a good term.

498
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:40,295
Don't get all dirty after
we go through the game.

499
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,029
What?

500
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,830
Don't pester me
with stupid demands.

501
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:00,280
I knew it.
Filthy blue collars.

502
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:05,688
That's the mentality
that you guys have.

503
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,023
Did the other girls want something
else after they hop into bed with you?

504
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,756
It must've been real bad,
wanting something else in return.

505
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,273
It was a joke.
Don't get all bitchy about that.

506
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,731
Let go! You disgust me.

507
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:20,195
You feel your
stamina wilt with age,

508
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,059
your skin goes dull,
and when there's nothing left

509
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,228
to charm the guys,
that's when you're done with.

510
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,475
So the great Oh Mi-sun

511
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,011
will get married
before she's done with?

512
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:40,780
No, it's just a thought!
It passed through my mind, you know.

513
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,376
Will Chul-ju marry you?

514
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,182
Who said l was marrying him?

515
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,526
What?
You mean there's someone else?

516
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,594
Drink.

517
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:56,555
Huh? l envy you, Mi-sun.

518
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,958
It's for you.

519
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:06,543
Seo Yu-na speaking.
Hello?

520
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,272
It's Young-jun here.

521
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,382
Another staff has been
assigned to you.

522
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,974
And who's call was that?

523
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,751
I don't see the need of continuing
our conversation.

524
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,386
Who is it?

525
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,079
No need to know.

526
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,988
i haven't seen you talk

527
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,759
that mean before.

528
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,793
No way it's a client of yours.

529
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,504
Something's fishy here...

530
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,377
Seo Yu-na here.
Thank you for calling.

531
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,945
I'll call back in 10 minutes.

532
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,412
Promise!

533
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,920
Seo Yu-na here.
Thank you for calling.

534
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,508
Perfect timing.
I just arrived.

535
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,613
What's with your voice?

536
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,782
What about it?

537
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,680
Aren't you glad to hear my voice?

538
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,819
I feel tired, that's all.

539
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,494
Look over the
11 o'clock direction.

540
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,947
- Did you have a hard time?
- Huh?

541
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:05,094
Yeah, couldn't sleep well.

542
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,660
I think I've caught a cold.

543
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,900
What about you?

544
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,469
How did you fare without me?

545
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,121
i missed you.

546
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,656
More than any other instance.

547
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,871
Don't switch it off.

548
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:00,477
How am I?

549
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,275
I'm sorry?

550
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:11,888
To women.
How do I fare as a man?

551
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,364
You're sick.

552
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,964
What?

553
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,274
An asshole too.

554
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,872
That's a little rude.

555
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,760
Hey...

556
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,404
Am I really that sick?

557
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:29,196
Do i look better
with my hair tied up or down?

558
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,777
Turn off the lights.

559
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,390
This isn't the first time,
you know.

560
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,360
I swear this will be
the last time. 30 grand.

561
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,963
Then your sister
will get the divorce.

562
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,397
i'm busy.
Don't call me with stuff like this.

563
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,633
Hey, hey!

564
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,965
It's a call for you.
Park Young-jun?

565
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,335
- This is for Ms. Kim. Hold onto it.
- Okay.

566
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,575
Hello?

567
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:09,136
Does the buyer usually have to
Iook for the seIIer?

568
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,349
I thought I had told you
that there's someone else for you.

569
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,917
I need something for an event.

570
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:14,851
l'll let the new personnel...

571
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,387
No need.
I want you to choose my wardrobe.

572
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,718
I'II have to hang up, I'm busy.

573
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,658
- Hyun-kyung, this one too.
- Yes.

574
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,297
You never know
what she'll look for.

575
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,321
Right.

576
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,706
Why record the voice
if you're not caIIing back?

577
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,004
Making people wait...

578
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,977
Keep your promise next time.

579
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,205
That's all.

580
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,611
Yes.

581
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:54,482
Mr. Park, you must be
having lunch?

582
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,526
Alone in your executive office?

583
00:49:56,526 --> 00:50:00,963
Having sushi with a piIe of
paperwork by your side?

584
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,165
Take some time to Iook back
at yourself, Mr. Park.

585
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,505
You'll realize how lonely
and pathetic you are.

586
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,939
That'll be all.

587
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,601
There's a package for you.

588
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,464
Sir...

589
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:55,136
The sample for the gallery arrived
from the head office.

590
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,345
Aren't you going to take a look?

591
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,731
Sir.

592
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:22,098
Why let out a sigh in
front of food?

593
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,440
- Because l'm hungry.
- But you're not eating.

594
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,477
i'm eating. Look.

595
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,250
Satisfied?

596
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,778
Hey, check out
that girl over there.

597
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,317
She's eating all alone,
and without any soju.

598
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,399
She must've been dumped by a guy.

599
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:06,675
- I've been wanting to call you...
- Are you always this quick in giving up?

600
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,813
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

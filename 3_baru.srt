601
0:55:59,430 --> 0:55:60,920
How about a truce at this stage?

602
0:56:2,66 --> 0:56:3,434
You really are some client.

603
0:56:3,434 --> 0:56:7,803
It's all my fault.
I beg for your forgiveness.

604
0:56:9,673 --> 0:56:12,335
Getting drunk is a bad excuse.
We were both very sober.

605
0:56:12,610 --> 0:56:15,704
So you really meant to treat me
like a whore?

606
0:56:15,913 --> 0:56:18,516
You looked like a pro,
working up a guy

607
0:56:18,516 --> 0:56:20,541
and leaving like that.

608
0:56:20,751 --> 0:56:23,151
Is this the attitude of someone
who has come for truce?

609
0:56:25,22 --> 0:56:27,992
You're the one playing down
on me right now.

610
0:56:27,992 --> 0:56:31,395
I'm not interested. I've never
been treated like this before.

611
0:56:31,395 --> 0:56:32,657
Move!

612
0:56:34,665 --> 0:56:35,996
Seo Yu-na!

613
0:56:59,56 --> 0:57:1,388
Are you out of your mind?

614
0:57:2,960 --> 0:57:6,497
How can you speed in
a parking lot, lady?

615
0:57:6,497 --> 0:57:8,294
I'm sorry.

616
0:57:10,901 --> 0:57:12,203
Let's get this over with.

617
0:57:12,203 --> 0:57:14,338
Doesn't seem like a
big accident to me.

618
0:57:14,338 --> 0:57:16,704
Who're you, anyway?

619
0:57:17,575 --> 0:57:18,940
I'm her guardian.

620
0:57:19,376 --> 0:57:22,937
Guardian, bull shit.
She's no kid, you know.

621
0:57:23,681 --> 0:57:25,410
Is he your husband?

622
0:57:25,749 --> 0:57:27,410
No.

623
0:57:27,651 --> 0:57:29,551
Who is he then?

624
0:57:30,788 --> 0:57:33,157
- He's a stalker.
- What?

625
0:57:33,157 --> 0:57:34,124
Stalker?

626
0:57:34,124 --> 0:57:39,357
He's been spying on me
for a few days.

627
0:57:39,964 --> 0:57:41,693
What nonsense are you talking?

628
0:57:41,866 --> 0:57:43,868
He was waiting
for me in front of the office,

629
0:57:43,868 --> 0:57:45,436
so l was trying to shake off him.

630
0:57:45,436 --> 0:57:47,199
Seo Yu-na!

631
0:57:47,371 --> 0:57:49,532
This is getting a little too
out of hand.

632
0:57:49,707 --> 0:57:51,368
Are you serious?

633
0:57:51,709 --> 0:57:53,574
You look pretty normal to me.

634
0:57:53,811 --> 0:57:56,146
Just give him a warning.

635
0:57:56,146 --> 0:57:58,740
I'll give him a good talk as well.

636
0:57:59,250 --> 0:58:2,913
He does seem to listen to others...

637
0:58:3,888 --> 0:58:6,379
so don't be too hard on him.

638
0:58:11,896 --> 0:58:13,761
- Thank you, officer.
- Take care on your way back home.

639
0:58:15,733 --> 0:58:17,860
What is he doing in there?

640
0:58:18,936 --> 0:58:21,461
He must've done something wrong.

641
0:58:24,74 --> 0:58:26,941
He should gladly pay for it, then.

642
0:58:31,315 --> 0:58:32,616
Why didn't you tell us
in the first place?

643
0:58:32,616 --> 0:58:34,718
Would you like some tea
before you leave?

644
0:58:34,718 --> 0:58:36,208
Seo Yu-na!

645
0:58:37,121 --> 0:58:38,645
Take care.

646
0:58:40,357 --> 0:58:41,790
Stop right there!

647
0:58:47,331 --> 0:58:49,196
What do you think you're doing?

648
0:58:49,400 --> 0:58:50,867
Are you satisfied now?

649
0:58:52,703 --> 0:58:54,933
You're damn right,
I'm satisfied.

650
0:58:56,106 --> 0:58:58,404
So you got one back on me.

651
0:58:59,243 --> 0:58:60,972
We're even now.

652
0:59:7,785 --> 0:59:9,844
Okay?

653
0:59:15,125 --> 0:59:18,492
Don't make a fool out of
other people, okay?

654
0:59:18,729 --> 0:59:20,458
Why? It's fun.

655
0:59:20,864 --> 0:59:22,695
Not to me.

656
0:59:25,536 --> 0:59:27,629
All right, I admit that
I made a fool out of you.

657
0:59:27,805 --> 0:59:33,72
But I don't do that to people
I don't care about!

658
0:59:34,979 --> 0:59:37,982
This is the first time
I've done this...

659
0:59:37,982 --> 0:59:40,348
Ever since I did it to
my neighbor when I was 10.

660
0:59:43,320 --> 0:59:45,49
I swear.

661
0:59:45,856 --> 0:59:47,224
What is it that you want?

662
0:59:47,224 --> 0:59:48,626
I told you. A truce.

663
0:59:48,626 --> 0:59:50,184
Is that all?

664
0:59:50,427 --> 0:59:53,260
- Let's go for a truce first...
- Then what?

665
0:59:57,501 --> 0:59:58,934
Haven't thought about it.

666
0:60:3,273 --> 0:60:8,879
Hey, when people want to reconcile,
they try to flatter

667
0:60:8,879 --> 0:60:11,905
or wait until the anger passes.

668
0:60:12,716 --> 0:60:15,651
You can't flatter a girl, can you?

669
0:60:16,854 --> 0:60:18,719
So let's just wait
until the anger passes.

670
0:60:24,194 --> 0:60:25,923
Let's have some coffee.

671
0:60:26,630 --> 0:60:29,326
I'm trying to flatter you,
that's all.

672
0:60:31,802 --> 0:60:33,167
Hey, Seo Yu-na!

673
0:60:34,304 --> 0:60:36,329
You've got some change?

674
1:1:11,442 --> 1:1:12,932
Jung Min-jae!

675
1:1:15,145 --> 1:1:17,170
Hey.

676
1:1:17,748 --> 1:1:19,545
What are you doing here?

677
1:1:22,352 --> 1:1:24,320
I had to meet someone here.

678
1:1:24,722 --> 1:1:27,486
I was on my way home.

679
1:1:28,659 --> 1:1:31,61
I'm going home too.

680
1:1:31,61 --> 1:1:32,653
Yeah, I'm done.

681
1:1:34,465 --> 1:1:36,797
- Let's go then.
- Right... What brought you here?

682
1:1:37,34 --> 1:1:39,970
I had an appointment with someone.

683
1:1:39,970 --> 1:1:41,631
I was on my way back.

684
1:2:44,34 --> 1:2:49,370
Min-jae, does your heart still throb
when you see me?

685
1:2:58,649 --> 1:2:59,946
Huh?

686
1:2:60,150 --> 1:3:3,313
Does your heart still pound
when you look at me?

687
1:3:7,124 --> 1:3:8,785
That was a little unexpected.

688
1:3:9,193 --> 1:3:10,956
Why?

689
1:3:14,832 --> 1:3:17,494
Come on, answer me.
Do you still feel that way?

690
1:3:19,570 --> 1:3:21,731
Hold on. Let me see...

691
1:3:22,539 --> 1:3:26,532
4 years of dating,
and 3 years of marriage...

692
1:3:26,777 --> 1:3:28,438
...and we have a diagnosis.

693
1:3:29,746 --> 1:3:32,772
If the heart is still beating like that,
it should be a heart disease.

694
1:3:37,521 --> 1:3:40,149
Jung Min-jae, you insolent bastard.

695
1:3:50,500 --> 1:3:51,797
Yu-na.

696
1:3:52,202 --> 1:3:54,534
Don't call me.
You've hurt my feelings.

697
1:3:56,73 --> 1:3:58,564
Make me go crazy about you again.

698
1:3:60,310 --> 1:4:3,74
Do you really feel
that way about me now?

699
1:4:36,213 --> 1:4:38,511
Hey, long time no see.

700
1:4:38,682 --> 1:4:42,85
I've been looking for you all day.

701
1:4:42,85 --> 1:4:44,110
And you weren't answering
my calls either.

702
1:4:50,961 --> 1:4:55,125
Let's see... in 3 minutes,
It'll be exactly 24 hours.

703
1:4:55,999 --> 1:4:58,399
I'm not in the mood
for a joke now.

704
1:5:9,680 --> 1:5:12,376
I understand how you
would've felt last night.

705
1:5:14,584 --> 1:5:16,74
But...

706
1:5:17,955 --> 1:5:20,753
i can't guarantee that something like
that will not happen again.

707
1:5:22,759 --> 1:5:24,920
There will be tougher times ahead.

708
1:5:28,832 --> 1:5:30,697
Why are you telling me this?

709
1:5:32,235 --> 1:5:36,69
i thought I had to tell you.
About your situation.

710
1:5:36,840 --> 1:5:38,501
The circumstances and all.

711
1:5:40,911 --> 1:5:43,379
And what difference will
that make?

712
1:5:49,586 --> 1:5:51,952
Someone has to pull the plug.

713
1:5:59,496 --> 1:6:1,88
What am I going to do?

714
1:6:5,902 --> 1:6:8,700
i can't think of
anything but you, Min-jae.

715
1:7:52,876 --> 1:7:56,312
Perfect. One hundred percent!

716
1:7:58,915 --> 1:8:1,349
You leave me
and don't give a call?

717
1:8:4,988 --> 1:8:9,891
Leave you? I went my way

718
1:8:11,461 --> 1:8:13,554
and you went yours.

719
1:8:14,865 --> 1:8:17,493
I got out of the way because
you might feel uncomfortable.

720
1:8:18,768 --> 1:8:22,568
Uncomfortable? Why?

721
1:8:26,76 --> 1:8:28,169
I thought we had a truce.

722
1:8:29,112 --> 1:8:32,343
I thought I had told you that
I needed some time.

723
1:8:36,253 --> 1:8:40,19
I'm not good at waiting.

724
1:8:40,190 --> 1:8:42,385
I'll flatter you instead.

725
1:8:44,761 --> 1:8:46,695
Well then, don't antagonize me.

726
1:8:48,431 --> 1:8:50,262
What brings you here?

727
1:8:50,600 --> 1:8:53,262
I'm here to see CHO Yu-na.

728
1:8:53,403 --> 1:8:56,72
I'm CHOl Dong-sup.

729
1:8:56,72 --> 1:8:57,733
She's not in.
Please step outside!

730
1:9:7,150 --> 1:9:8,447
Who's that?

731
1:9:10,53 --> 1:9:10,820
You don't need to know.

732
1:9:10,820 --> 1:9:13,757
Tell your manager her sister's
husband is here to see her!

733
1:9:13,757 --> 1:9:15,659
What's going on?
What is this all about?

734
1:9:15,659 --> 1:9:20,397
- Wait. Don't do this.
- Hey, Seo Yu-na! This isn't funny at all.

735
1:9:20,397 --> 1:9:21,898
- Please.
- Let's do business the safe way.

736
1:9:21,898 --> 1:9:24,267
Shit, do you want your sister
to get in trouble?

737
1:9:24,267 --> 1:9:26,870
Hey, you know what
your sister did to me?

738
1:9:26,870 --> 1:9:29,339
I've been set up.
Set up real bad, you hear?

739
1:9:29,339 --> 1:9:31,41
Let's call it a deal at 30 grand.

740
1:9:31,41 --> 1:9:33,43
I'm a victim too, you know.

741
1:9:33,43 --> 1:9:35,34
Take him outside!

742
1:9:48,625 --> 1:9:51,719
Go change your suit.
I'll take it to your car.

743
1:10:34,638 --> 1:10:35,627
Who's that?

744
1:10:35,805 --> 1:10:37,534
Young-jun's step-mother.

745
1:10:42,746 --> 1:10:44,236
Hello.

746
1:10:44,681 --> 1:10:47,479
Hi, there.
Working so late?

747
1:10:47,717 --> 1:10:49,119
What brings you here?

748
1:10:49,119 --> 1:10:53,453
I was passing by and
saw the lights on.

749
1:10:55,91 --> 1:10:56,854
Is he a new employee?

750
1:10:57,627 --> 1:10:59,362
I'm from the construction company.

751
1:10:59,362 --> 1:11:1,523
Is that right?

752
1:11:1,831 --> 1:11:3,594
So-yeo, I'll talk to
you later then.

753
1:11:3,733 --> 1:11:5,30
Right.

754
1:11:14,944 --> 1:11:16,775
How's everything going?

755
1:11:16,913 --> 1:11:19,381
Fine.

756
1:11:20,383 --> 1:11:22,112
I'll be on my way then.

757
1:11:23,653 --> 1:11:25,889
Leaving already?

758
1:11:25,889 --> 1:11:28,425
Don't stay here till late at night.

759
1:11:28,425 --> 1:11:30,586
Your husband won't like it.

760
1:11:35,265 --> 1:11:37,62
I'll see you at
your father-in-law's birthday.

761
1:11:39,502 --> 1:11:41,663
Take care.

762
1:12:3,860 --> 1:12:6,294
It'll be okay.

763
1:12:8,164 --> 1:12:12,328
Right. Nothing happened, really.

764
1:12:20,9 --> 1:12:21,772
Let's go to Hong Kong.

765
1:12:24,80 --> 1:12:25,604
Hong Kong?

766
1:12:26,516 --> 1:12:28,416
It was great at Hong Kong, the two of us.

767
1:12:31,688 --> 1:12:33,622
There's no one to recognize us...

768
1:12:35,258 --> 1:12:39,24
Alright. I'm going to
Hong Kong right now!

769
1:13:2,452 --> 1:13:4,682
Answer the phone, damn it!

770
1:13:23,773 --> 1:13:25,297
So you're here to rake
in some cash?

771
1:13:26,643 --> 1:13:27,837
You can't have it for free, though.

772
1:13:38,888 --> 1:13:40,185
Call me.

773
1:13:45,128 --> 1:13:47,289
Hey, Yu-na.

774
1:13:50,900 --> 1:13:53,994
That's some pimp you have there.

775
1:14:4,247 --> 1:14:6,215
What have you done?

776
1:14:6,382 --> 1:14:6,950
No need to know.

777
1:14:6,950 --> 1:14:8,815
Who do you think you are anyway?

778
1:14:9,18 --> 1:14:11,179
Pretend you didn't see that.

779
1:14:11,888 --> 1:14:13,753
Do you think I'm stupid?

780
1:14:15,291 --> 1:14:16,622
Yeah.

781
1:14:17,494 --> 1:14:19,428
Do I look pathetic to you?

782
1:14:19,996 --> 1:14:22,897
Yeah. Pretty much.

783
1:14:41,50 --> 1:14:43,450
I know you're crying
because you're flattered.

784
1:14:57,367 --> 1:14:60,530
That'll be the last favor.

785
1:15:2,438 --> 1:15:6,898
What do you mean?
It only has just started.

786
1:15:7,544 --> 1:15:10,536
'Until we satisfy'.

787
1:15:11,614 --> 1:15:13,741
There's nothing I can do
to return the favor.

788
1:15:15,552 --> 1:15:17,417
Have I asked for anything?

789
1:15:18,821 --> 1:15:23,588
You know... what I mean.

790
1:15:28,531 --> 1:15:31,728
I can't leave my husband like this.

791
1:15:33,69 --> 1:15:34,730
What about me?

792
1:15:42,11 --> 1:15:44,138
You can't live without me?

793
1:15:50,320 --> 1:15:51,878
No.

794
1:15:55,725 --> 1:15:57,22
See what l mean?

795
1:15:57,293 --> 1:16:2,492
Your husband will feel the same way.

796
1:16:2,699 --> 1:16:4,564
You girls misjudge men.

797
1:16:10,807 --> 1:16:12,866
Min-jae's not like you!

798
1:17:57,46 --> 1:18:3,645
I really wanted to
flirt with you, Seo Yu-na...

799
1:19:23,65 --> 1:19:25,761
Can I speak to Jung Min-jae?

800
1:19:28,70 --> 1:19:31,403
I wish to thank him
for the arrangements.

801
1:19:32,341 --> 1:19:33,740
Really?

802
1:19:36,712 --> 1:19:41,445
Tell him to drop by
the members' lounge when he returns.

803
1:19:41,584 --> 1:19:43,415
Or I'll go there to meet him.

804
1:19:44,720 --> 1:19:48,349
All right. Thank you.

805
1:21:32,628 --> 1:21:36,564
I'm telling you this
because I like So-yeo.

806
1:21:36,799 --> 1:21:41,65
You've got to end this
sort of relationship.

807
1:22:6,62 --> 1:22:7,927
Hmm. Right.

808
1:22:8,130 --> 1:22:9,765
Did you make it out of the
ladies' room safely?

809
1:22:9,765 --> 1:22:11,460
Of course.

810
1:22:12,969 --> 1:22:14,770
What's that tone then?

811
1:22:14,770 --> 1:22:15,805
Hmm?

812
1:22:15,805 --> 1:22:17,636
You sound weary.

813
1:22:19,8 --> 1:22:22,774
Must be a weak throat.

814
1:22:25,781 --> 1:22:28,249
You shouldn't be calling...

815
1:22:29,251 --> 1:22:31,776
With your husband around.

816
1:22:33,789 --> 1:22:37,156
I've got something to do,
I won't be able to see you tonight.

817
1:22:39,261 --> 1:22:42,992
Overtime work.

818
1:22:43,632 --> 1:22:45,429
Let's talk Iater.

819
1:23:13,829 --> 1:23:15,626
I thought you wouldn't pick up.

820
1:23:15,798 --> 1:23:17,698
Should l hang up then?

821
1:23:18,534 --> 1:23:22,937
That temper of yours...
Is everything aII right?

822
1:23:23,572 --> 1:23:25,5
Yeah.

823
1:23:25,674 --> 1:23:27,437
You alone?

824
1:23:30,679 --> 1:23:35,116
Why should I be alone?
My husband's always by my side.

825
1:23:37,386 --> 1:23:41,83
Like your wife is by your side,
Young-jun.

826
1:23:42,958 --> 1:23:47,588
Thanks for reminding me.

827
1:23:51,467 --> 1:23:53,636
I'll hang up since I've heard your voice.

828
1:23:53,636 --> 1:23:55,1
Wait.

829
1:23:59,208 --> 1:24:1,403
Don't eat by yourself!

830
1:24:1,811 --> 1:24:4,939
Don't bother if you're not
going to eat with me.

831
1:24:6,582 --> 1:24:7,776
Hang up.

832
1:25:17,620 --> 1:25:18,821
There's a guest calling to order.

833
1:25:18,821 --> 1:25:21,590
- Hey.
- Hey! You made it.

834
1:25:21,590 --> 1:25:22,725
Hello!

835
1:25:22,725 --> 1:25:24,215
Good to see you all.

836
1:25:26,295 --> 1:25:28,263
So... Is everyone here?

837
1:25:28,497 --> 1:25:30,658
We have an announcement to make.

838
1:25:30,933 --> 1:25:33,731
We're getting married!

839
1:25:40,9 --> 1:25:41,544
Who? You and me?

840
1:25:41,544 --> 1:25:44,513
Right, I decided to let
you get married to me.

841
1:25:44,513 --> 1:25:45,681
You should be proud!

842
1:25:45,681 --> 1:25:48,377
Don't you think that's
a little too one-sided?

843
1:25:48,651 --> 1:25:51,954
You're got the bar
and apartment mortgaged.

844
1:25:51,954 --> 1:25:54,456
You need someone
to rescue your life.

845
1:25:54,456 --> 1:25:56,58
Hey, you shouldn't believe entirely
what my father tells you.

846
1:25:56,58 --> 1:26:1,130
Mi-sun, why get married
at the prime of life?

847
1:26:1,130 --> 1:26:2,665
You've still got it all.

848
1:26:2,665 --> 1:26:4,690
There's nothing to lose.

849
1:26:5,301 --> 1:26:8,204
I would say the same
thing to Chul-ju.

850
1:26:8,204 --> 1:26:10,764
There are younger girls
all over the place.

851
1:26:11,373 --> 1:26:14,137
Not all men think like you do,
my dear.

852
1:26:14,443 --> 1:26:17,241
Women these days aren't
like you either.

853
1:26:18,147 --> 1:26:20,583
That's why I don't
bring her to gatherings.

854
1:26:20,583 --> 1:26:22,949
Who made her come, anyway?

855
1:26:23,719 --> 1:26:26,950
Stop toying with your cell phone.
What have you been doing?

856
1:26:28,924 --> 1:26:30,859
What is it with you these days?

857
1:26:30,859 --> 1:26:34,158
You're not like you used to be.

858
1:26:35,30 --> 1:26:36,732
There are times, Yu-na.

859
1:26:36,732 --> 1:26:39,462
Times? What times?

860
1:26:41,470 --> 1:26:43,768
Forget it.

861
1:26:46,942 --> 1:26:48,544
Something's strange today.

862
1:26:48,544 --> 1:26:50,79
Should I have kept
the announcement for later?

863
1:26:50,79 --> 1:26:51,614
It's not like we're
breaking up, you know.

864
1:26:51,614 --> 1:26:54,845
Damn, what is it with you people?

865
1:27:2,625 --> 1:27:4,92
Yu-na.

866
1:27:4,426 --> 1:27:6,587
Am I doing the right thing?

867
1:27:8,63 --> 1:27:9,690
I don't know...

868
1:27:10,266 --> 1:27:14,570
One thing I'm sure of is that
it becomes quite boring as you live along.

869
1:27:14,570 --> 1:27:18,165
Hey there's no couple more into
each other than you guys.

870
1:27:19,708 --> 1:27:23,303
I just had to make him mine
when I first met him.

871
1:27:23,912 --> 1:27:27,780
I could feel the passion
when I saw his face.

872
1:27:27,983 --> 1:27:29,746
And you don't feel that now?

873
1:27:31,353 --> 1:27:35,551
If you feel that now, you're ill.

874
1:27:38,927 --> 1:27:41,96
Nothing excites me anymore.

875
1:27:41,96 --> 1:27:42,961
Stop that.

876
1:27:44,600 --> 1:27:49,905
I can see that your relationship
has reached its peak.

877
1:27:49,905 --> 1:27:51,566
Pretty much.

878
1:27:51,774 --> 1:27:53,969
What's up with you guys?

879
1:27:54,977 --> 1:27:57,468
How are you guys?

880
1:27:58,981 --> 1:28:3,52
Nothing has changed between us
after we got married.

881
1:28:3,52 --> 1:28:4,815
Really?

882
1:28:5,287 --> 1:28:7,448
I envy you guys.

883
1:28:7,956 --> 1:28:10,823
I've never felt passionate
about him.

884
1:28:13,262 --> 1:28:16,527
I'm beginning to like
this gathering!

885
1:28:16,765 --> 1:28:18,699
Mr. Park.

886
1:28:19,168 --> 1:28:22,729
What have you done to
make her say that?

887
1:28:23,605 --> 1:28:26,267
Is not being passionat a bad thing?

888
1:28:27,476 --> 1:28:30,639
There's no need to get all cold
if you're not passionate.

889
1:28:30,846 --> 1:28:32,214
Jung Min-jae.
What is wrong with you?

890
1:28:32,214 --> 1:28:33,704
Are you drunk?

891
1:28:34,149 --> 1:28:37,141
I'm not saying that it's bad,
but it's not a good thing either.

892
1:28:38,287 --> 1:28:40,482
What is this guy saying?

893
1:28:40,889 --> 1:28:42,379
Min-jae!

894
1:28:43,359 --> 1:28:45,486
Can I ask you something?

895
1:28:51,900 --> 1:28:54,562
No, we'll talk later.

896
1:28:57,272 --> 1:29:1,810
This is weird. Is there something
wrong with the drinks?

897
1:29:1,810 --> 1:29:3,641
I'll go check.

898
1:29:3,946 --> 1:29:6,248
Do we have bootlegs here?

899
1:29:6,248 --> 1:29:8,443
Why does my stomach hurt?

900
1:29:16,158 --> 1:29:17,455
Let's go home.

901
1:29:32,875 --> 1:29:34,467
It looks original to me...

902
1:29:49,425 --> 1:29:51,518
Why are you doing this to me?

903
1:29:52,961 --> 1:29:55,361
The ladies' room is
on the opposite side.

904
1:29:58,300 --> 1:30:1,792
I've never feared losing

905
1:30:1,937 --> 1:30:4,997
what l have since
I started seeing you.

906
1:30:7,876 --> 1:30:10,845
But it looks like you're
the one getting scared.

907
1:30:12,881 --> 1:30:14,143
That's easy for you to say.

908
1:30:15,751 --> 1:30:17,844
Is that because you're rich?

909
1:30:18,921 --> 1:30:21,56
I haven't got much, and I've paid
a lot to earn what I have now.

910
1:30:21,56 --> 1:30:24,924
That's why I'm scared
of losing them

911
1:30:27,396 --> 1:30:29,330
I'm like that, you know.

912
1:30:36,738 --> 1:30:39,605
I know you're doing
that on purpose

913
1:30:44,813 --> 1:30:46,974
I'll wait at 'Beginning'.

914
1:30:47,649 --> 1:30:49,14
Don't.

915
1:30:51,820 --> 1:30:52,878
What are you doing?

916
1:30:53,455 --> 1:30:55,13
Wait...

917
1:30:55,858 --> 1:30:59,661
The toilet's blocked!

918
1:30:59,661 --> 1:31:3,563
We get that often these days.
Use the one on the second floor.

919
1:31:25,754 --> 1:31:28,156
Mi-sun, am I drunk?

920
1:31:28,156 --> 1:31:30,784
You will be
if you drink at that rate.

921
1:31:32,761 --> 1:31:34,456
Where's Min-jae?

922
1:31:35,731 --> 1:31:37,289
How would I know?

923
1:31:37,499 --> 1:31:39,262
I asked Yu-na.

924
1:31:46,74 --> 1:31:47,666
You going?

925
1:31:58,220 --> 1:31:59,121
I'm leaving too.

926
1:31:59,121 --> 1:32:3,125
Yu-na. Sit here for a little while.
Mi-sun, talk to her!

927
1:32:3,125 --> 1:32:3,992
Stay, Yu-na.

928
1:32:3,992 --> 1:32:5,160
What's with you?

929
1:32:5,160 --> 1:32:7,458
Sit down, girl!

930
1:32:11,99 --> 1:32:12,801
Hey, let's have another drink.

931
1:32:12,801 --> 1:32:15,237
Shit, I knew she wouldn't
listen to me.

932
1:32:15,237 --> 1:32:18,1
Hey, forget it, I'm not getting
involved in this anymore!

933
1:32:25,881 --> 1:32:27,508
Seo Yu-na!

934
1:32:29,518 --> 1:32:31,748
Your husband...

935
1:32:39,127 --> 1:32:41,721
If he says he'll be able to
live without you...

936
1:32:43,699 --> 1:32:45,496
Can we make it happen?

937
1:32:48,537 --> 1:32:49,868
Answer me.

938
1:32:55,177 --> 1:32:56,269
No.

939
1:32:59,81 --> 1:33:1,515
I can't live without him.

940
1:34:7,382 --> 1:34:8,542
Chul-ju!

941
1:34:8,750 --> 1:34:9,944
Hey.

942
1:34:10,152 --> 1:34:11,619
I want to ask for a favor.

943
1:34:14,856 --> 1:34:19,850
Min-jae must be
seeing someone else.

944
1:34:22,230 --> 1:34:24,130
Talk him to end the relationship.

945
1:34:27,402 --> 1:34:31,202
I owe you one.
They're close friends of yours.

946
1:34:32,674 --> 1:34:34,164
I'm leaving.

947
1:34:39,414 --> 1:34:42,281
Young-jun, hey!

948
1:34:45,287 --> 1:34:47,221
Oh man...

949
1:35:2,70 --> 1:35:9,374
Yu-na. What are you doing here?

950
1:35:13,648 --> 1:35:15,275
Is that true?

951
1:35:18,153 --> 1:35:20,917
What is?

952
1:35:26,161 --> 1:35:30,461
About Min-jae seeing someone else.
Is that true?

953
1:35:35,637 --> 1:35:37,195
Hey, Yu-na...

954
1:35:38,940 --> 1:35:45,368
You should know better.
He can't live without you.

955
1:35:48,16 --> 1:35:51,281
What do I do, Chul-ju?

956
1:35:52,20 --> 1:35:54,614
What am I going to do?

957
1:37:44,599 --> 1:37:46,396
Yu-na,

958
1:37:47,836 --> 1:37:49,98
are you asleep?

959
1:38:13,328 --> 1:38:14,693
I'm sorry.

960
1:38:34,950 --> 1:38:36,815
I'm sorry too.

961
1:38:41,923 --> 1:38:43,584
What for?

962
1:38:49,364 --> 1:38:51,559
About being all petty...

963
1:38:52,701 --> 1:38:55,192
not giving you enough pocket money...

964
1:38:55,603 --> 1:38:57,127
I'm sorry.

965
1:39:15,523 --> 1:39:16,922
Yu-na.

966
1:39:21,196 --> 1:39:23,858
We both know that we've
come this far

967
1:39:25,867 --> 1:39:28,734
because of you.

968
1:39:41,282 --> 1:39:42,772
Min-jae,

969
1:39:43,485 --> 1:39:46,318
let's have a baby.

970
1:39:49,457 --> 1:39:53,655
You wanted that, right?

971
1:39:60,1 --> 1:40:1,866
Yu-na,

972
1:40:3,38 --> 1:40:4,596
I've got something to tell you.

973
1:40:11,479 --> 1:40:15,40
I must be drunk.

974
1:40:18,486 --> 1:40:20,113
Let's talk later.

975
1:40:30,131 --> 1:40:31,792
Will you...

976
1:40:36,471 --> 1:40:38,336
...hit me, Yu-na?

977
1:40:58,359 --> 1:40:60,88
Aren't you coming to bed?

978
1:41:2,730 --> 1:41:4,595
I've got a question to ask you.

979
1:41:9,871 --> 1:41:11,463
Am I...

980
1:41:12,740 --> 1:41:14,867
...really that cold-hearted?

981
1:41:16,678 --> 1:41:20,341
Yeah. You didn't know?

982
1:41:23,451 --> 1:41:26,386
That's what makes you attractive.

983
1:41:27,21 --> 1:41:29,717
That's what I fell for too.

984
1:41:42,370 --> 1:41:44,770
Can I ask something too?

985
1:41:52,647 --> 1:41:54,672
Was...

986
1:41:57,152 --> 1:41:58,551
I...

987
1:41:59,821 --> 1:42:1,686
...a woman to you?

988
1:42:5,393 --> 1:42:7,20
You're my wife.

989
1:42:10,665 --> 1:42:18,162
But when you said
we were never passionate,

990
1:42:19,874 --> 1:42:21,808
I realized that you were a woman.

991
1:42:27,515 --> 1:42:30,416
When did you say you were
leaving for Hong Kong?

992
1:42:34,556 --> 1:42:36,157
Next weekend.

993
1:42:36,157 --> 1:42:38,125
Should I go with you?

994
1:42:40,361 --> 1:42:43,159
You're just saying that, right?

995
1:42:45,733 --> 1:42:47,360
Yeah.

996
1:42:54,542 --> 1:42:56,611
Oh, beautiful night.

997
1:42:56,611 --> 1:42:59,814
- That was some wedding ceremony!
- Thank you.

998
1:42:59,814 --> 1:43:4,183
- You look wonderful, dear!
- Thank you so much.

999
1:43:7,288 --> 1:43:8,890
You guys still haven't left?

1000
1:43:8,890 --> 1:43:11,256
You really want to drink, huh?

1001
1:43:11,392 --> 1:43:13,561
Here, have a drink. Come on.

1002
1:43:13,561 --> 1:43:15,730
Right. l'd be glad to!

1003
1:43:15,730 --> 1:43:18,233
So, you've settled everything?

1004
1:43:18,233 --> 1:43:21,532
Yeah. It's not easy doing
a son's duty.

1005
1:43:22,3 --> 1:43:25,707
What's not easy?
You've got a beautiful wife!

1006
1:43:25,707 --> 1:43:30,110
Now that l see it,
I wish l could get married again.

1007
1:43:31,79 --> 1:43:34,537
You guys won't die
for each other, right?

1008
1:43:34,916 --> 1:43:36,406
Of course not.

1009
1:43:36,684 --> 1:43:38,811
No, not at all.

1010
1:43:38,987 --> 1:43:43,825
You won't feel like a victim, then.

1011
1:43:43,825 --> 1:43:46,692
So you won't have
to hate each other.

1012
1:43:46,995 --> 1:43:50,658
felt like a victim
whenever he flirted.

1013
1:43:50,798 --> 1:43:52,732
That's why I hate him.

1014
1:43:53,101 --> 1:43:57,902
I couldn't show that to my kids,

1015
1:43:58,139 --> 1:43:60,733
so now l've got
a lump on my chest.

1016
1:43:60,842 --> 1:44:3,777
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

1017
1:44:4,646 --> 1:44:7,945
I couldn't bear watching you enjoy.

1018
1:44:8,683 --> 1:44:11,652
Man, this is why l didn't want
to bring her along.

1019
1:44:11,919 --> 1:44:16,624
Sir, don't live like that,
damn it.

1020
1:44:16,624 --> 1:44:17,784
What?

1021
1:44:18,26 --> 1:44:20,61
You really like the young ones,
don't you?

1022
1:44:20,61 --> 1:44:21,289
What's wrong with you?

1023
1:44:22,96 --> 1:44:23,298
Chul-ju!

1024
1:44:23,298 --> 1:44:27,702
Let's exchange partners if you're
so much into young girls.

1025
1:44:27,702 --> 1:44:28,636
What did you say?

1026
1:44:28,636 --> 1:44:29,470
Hey.

1027
1:44:29,470 --> 1:44:31,739
Everyone's changing partners,

1028
1:44:31,739 --> 1:44:33,400
So why not us?

1029
1:44:33,574 --> 1:44:35,576
Why you son of a...

1030
1:44:35,576 --> 1:44:38,739
Alright. Let's do it!

1031
1:44:38,913 --> 1:44:40,710
Are you drunk?

1032
1:44:41,416 --> 1:44:42,883
What's wrong with that?

1033
1:44:43,451 --> 1:44:46,54
You're doing it,
so why can't I do the same?

1034
1:44:46,54 --> 1:44:48,589
Hey, Chul-ju's drunk.
Take him to the hotel.

1035
1:44:48,589 --> 1:44:49,223
Let's go!

1036
1:44:49,223 --> 1:44:51,248
Hey, cut the crap.

1037
1:44:52,226 --> 1:44:54,862
I'll help you guys out, too.

1038
1:44:54,862 --> 1:44:58,66
I can't stand you guys
sulk any longer.

1039
1:44:58,66 --> 1:45:1,202
So I'll settle everything for you!

1040
1:45:1,202 --> 1:45:4,138
You know how?
I've got the solution right here.

1041
1:45:4,138 --> 1:45:5,540
Stop it. Are you crazy?

1042
1:45:5,540 --> 1:45:7,675
Yeah, I'm crazy.
You see, l had to pretend to

1043
1:45:7,675 --> 1:45:9,944
be naive all along,
that must've made me go mad.

1044
1:45:9,944 --> 1:45:11,579
I'm crazy. So what?

1045
1:45:11,579 --> 1:45:13,481
- Hey, Kang Chul-ju!
- Sir, sir!

1046
1:45:13,481 --> 1:45:15,249
We should swap too.
You like younger girls, right?

1047
1:45:15,249 --> 1:45:17,652
No, to think of it...

1048
1:45:17,652 --> 1:45:23,124
Let's all swap here. Okay?

1049
1:45:23,124 --> 1:45:25,493
Come here,
you little piece of shit!

1050
1:45:25,493 --> 1:45:28,155
- Settle down.
- Flirt, flirt!

1051
1:45:29,364 --> 1:45:31,628
I'm not marrying
a madman like that.

1052
1:45:32,967 --> 1:45:35,629
Well thought, Mi-sun!

1053
1:45:36,70 --> 1:45:39,540
Look at these guys over here...

1054
1:45:39,540 --> 1:45:42,310
They meet. They get bored.

1055
1:45:42,310 --> 1:45:44,712
So they look for someone else.

1056
1:45:44,712 --> 1:45:47,815
Min-jae here likes So-yeo...

1057
1:45:47,815 --> 1:45:50,685
And Young-jun here,
worries about Yu-na.

1058
1:45:50,685 --> 1:45:53,955
Bastard. l'm getting rid of
this ring right now!

1059
1:45:53,955 --> 1:45:56,624
Mi-sun. Mi-sun!
Don't do this!

1060
1:45:56,624 --> 1:45:58,126
- Let go!
- He's drunk, Mi-sun.

1061
1:45:58,126 --> 1:45:59,218
l said, let go!

1062
1:46:6,667 --> 1:46:7,827
Oh no!

1063
1:47:46,667 --> 1:47:49,363
Chul-jung's father passed away.

1064
1:47:58,45 --> 1:47:60,206
Yeah, I should go.

1065
1:48:1,582 --> 1:48:3,243
Want me to pick you up?

1066
1:48:16,63 --> 1:48:21,558
May Damiano KANG rest
in eternal peace.

1067
1:48:21,736 --> 1:48:26,696
Lord, hear our prayer.

1068
1:48:26,841 --> 1:48:33,114
May the Lord's words pass upon generations
to come,

1069
1:48:33,114 --> 1:48:35,776
these are the words of the gospel.

1070
1:48:42,924 --> 1:48:44,84
How's your sister doing?

1071
1:48:45,526 --> 1:48:47,858
Is she preparing for the wedding?

1072
1:48:49,630 --> 1:48:52,861
I don't know why she's
getting married again.

1073
1:48:53,968 --> 1:48:56,698
She should be happy now.

1074
1:48:57,672 --> 1:48:59,697
That's funny.

1075
1:48:60,508 --> 1:49:3,375
Who says marriage
guarantees happiness?

1076
1:49:5,713 --> 1:49:8,614
Was I happy before?

1077
1:49:9,850 --> 1:49:12,148
I don't even remember.

1078
1:49:14,689 --> 1:49:16,919
You can be mad about me, Yu-na.

1079
1:49:17,825 --> 1:49:20,919
But don't erase
all the good memories.

1080
1:49:34,976 --> 1:49:38,707
Do you still eat by yourself?

1081
1:49:39,914 --> 1:49:42,906
Yeah. I'm a loner.

1082
1:49:46,20 --> 1:49:48,250
I'm curious.

1083
1:49:50,191 --> 1:49:54,992
Why did you marry me?

1084
1:49:59,867 --> 1:50:2,700
I went to the construction site

1085
1:50:5,573 --> 1:50:12,479
and saw a girl on a suit
wearing a helmet.

1086
1:50:13,748 --> 1:50:17,451
You usually don't wear helmets
because it ruins your suit.

1087
1:50:17,451 --> 1:50:22,354
But this girl had a helmet on.

1088
1:50:23,491 --> 1:50:25,459
I wanted to find out
more about her.

1089
1:50:29,363 --> 1:50:33,424
So you came to see me
before the actual meeting?

1090
1:50:34,201 --> 1:50:35,361
Yeah.

1091
1:50:39,874 --> 1:50:46,109
So... We didn't start out
that bad either.

1092
1:50:50,384 --> 1:50:53,581
My car's over there.

1093
1:50:54,588 --> 1:50:56,257
Take care.

1094
1:50:56,257 --> 1:50:57,554
Bye.

1095
1:51:4,98 --> 1:51:5,656
Bye.

1096
1:51:12,306 --> 1:51:13,796
See you guys later.

1097
1:51:14,41 --> 1:51:14,909
Bye.

1098
1:51:14,909 --> 1:51:16,467
Bye.

1099
1:52:1,355 --> 1:52:4,483
You lost your way on purpose
in Hong Kong, right?

1100
1:52:5,526 --> 1:52:7,16
What?

1101
1:52:7,661 --> 1:52:9,788
You were teasing me,
weren't you?

1102
1:52:11,665 --> 1:52:13,968
Who talked to me
about the full moon?

1103
1:52:13,968 --> 1:52:18,132
You're the one that called it
a lame secret.

1104
1:52:22,643 --> 1:52:25,9
I'm going to Hong Kong next month.

1105
1:52:27,648 --> 1:52:29,445
Lucky you.

1106
1:52:29,617 --> 1:52:35,578
Garupa and Mantis shrimp,
remember all that?

1107
1:52:40,461 --> 1:52:42,622
I'll think about it.

1108
1:52:43,798 --> 1:52:46,62
Who said l was taking you?

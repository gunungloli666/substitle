1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,720
How about a truce at this stage?

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,234
You really are some client.

3
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:13,603
It's all my fault.
I beg for your forgiveness.

4
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,135
Getting drunk is a bad excuse.
We were both very sober.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,504
So you really meant to treat me
like a whore?

6
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:24,316
You looked like a pro,
working up a guy

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,341
and leaving like that.

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,951
Is this the attitude of someone
who has come for truce?

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,792
You're the one playing down
on me right now.

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,195
I'm not interested. I've never
been treated like this before.

11
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:38,457
Move!

12
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:41,796
Seo Yu-na!

13
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,188
Are you out of your mind?

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,297
How can you speed in
a parking lot, lady?

15
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:14,094
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,003
Let's get this over with.

17
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:20,138
Doesn't seem like a
big accident to me.

18
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:22,504
Who're you, anyway?

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,740
I'm her guardian.

20
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:28,737
Guardian, bull shit.
She's no kid, you know.

21
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,210
Is he your husband?

22
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,210
No.

23
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,351
Who is he then?

24
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:38,957
- He's a stalker.
- What?

25
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:39,924
Stalker?

26
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:45,157
He's been spying on me
for a few days.

27
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:47,493
What nonsense are you talking?

28
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,668
He was waiting
for me in front of the office,

29
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:51,236
so l was trying to shake off him.

30
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,999
Seo Yu-na!

31
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,332
This is getting a little too
out of hand.

32
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,168
Are you serious?

33
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,374
You look pretty normal to me.

34
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,946
Just give him a warning.

35
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,540
I'll give him a good talk as well.

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,713
He does seem to listen to others...

37
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:12,179
so don't be too hard on him.

38
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,561
- Thank you, officer.
- Take care on your way back home.

39
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,660
What is he doing in there?

40
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,261
He must've done something wrong.

41
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,741
He should gladly pay for it, then.

42
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,416
Why didn't you tell us
in the first place?

43
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,518
Would you like some tea
before you leave?

44
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,008
Seo Yu-na!

45
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,445
Take care.

46
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:47,590
Stop right there!

47
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,996
What do you think you're doing?

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,667
Are you satisfied now?

49
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,733
You're damn right,
I'm satisfied.

50
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:04,204
So you got one back on me.

51
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:06,772
We're even now.

52
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:15,644
Okay?

53
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,292
Don't make a fool out of
other people, okay?

54
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,258
Why? It's fun.

55
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,495
Not to me.

56
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,429
All right, I admit that
I made a fool out of you.

57
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:38,872
But I don't do that to people
I don't care about!

58
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:43,782
This is the first time
I've done this...

59
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,148
Ever since I did it to
my neighbor when I was 10.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,849
I swear.

61
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:53,024
What is it that you want?

62
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,426
I told you. A truce.

63
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,984
Is that all?

64
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:59,060
- Let's go for a truce first...
- Then what?

65
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:04,734
Haven't thought about it.

66
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:14,679
Hey, when people want to reconcile,
they try to flatter

67
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:17,705
or wait until the anger passes.

68
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:21,451
You can't flatter a girl, can you?

69
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:24,519
So let's just wait
until the anger passes.

70
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:31,723
Let's have some coffee.

71
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,126
I'm trying to flatter you,
that's all.

72
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,967
Hey, Seo Yu-na!

73
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:42,129
You've got some change?

74
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,732
Jung Min-jae!

75
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,970
Hey.

76
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,345
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,120
I had to meet someone here.

78
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:33,286
I was on my way home.

79
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,861
I'm going home too.

80
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,453
Yeah, I'm done.

81
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,597
- Let's go then.
- Right... What brought you here?

82
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,770
I had an appointment with someone.

83
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,431
I was on my way back.

84
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:55,170
Min-jae, does your heart still throb
when you see me?

85
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:05,746
Huh?

86
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,113
Does your heart still pound
when you look at me?

87
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,585
That was a little unexpected.

88
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:16,756
Why?

89
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:23,294
Come on, answer me.
Do you still feel that way?

90
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,531
Hold on. Let me see...

91
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,332
4 years of dating,
and 3 years of marriage...

92
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,238
...and we have a diagnosis.

93
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:38,572
If the heart is still beating like that,
it should be a heart disease.

94
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,949
Jung Min-jae, you insolent bastard.

95
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,597
Yu-na.

96
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,334
Don't call me.
You've hurt my feelings.

97
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,364
Make me go crazy about you again.

98
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,874
Do you really feel
that way about me now?

99
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,311
Hey, long time no see.

100
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,885
I've been looking for you all day.

101
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,910
And you weren't answering
my calls either.

102
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:00,925
Let's see... in 3 minutes,
It'll be exactly 24 hours.

103
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,199
I'm not in the mood
for a joke now.

104
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,176
I understand how you
would've felt last night.

105
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:21,874
But...

106
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,553
i can't guarantee that something like
that will not happen again.

107
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,720
There will be tougher times ahead.

108
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:36,497
Why are you telling me this?

109
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,869
i thought I had to tell you.
About your situation.

110
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,301
The circumstances and all.

111
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,179
And what difference will
that make?

112
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,752
Someone has to pull the plug.

113
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:06,888
What am I going to do?

114
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:14,500
i can't think of
anything but you, Min-jae.

115
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,112
Perfect. One hundred percent!

116
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,149
You leave me
and don't give a call?

117
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:15,691
Leave you? I went my way

118
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,354
and you went yours.

119
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:23,293
I got out of the way because
you might feel uncomfortable.

120
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:28,368
Uncomfortable? Why?

121
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,969
I thought we had a truce.

122
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:38,143
I thought I had told you that
I needed some time.

123
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,819
I'm not good at waiting.

124
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,185
I'll flatter you instead.

125
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,495
Well then, don't antagonize me.

126
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,062
What brings you here?

127
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,062
I'm here to see CHO Yu-na.

128
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,872
I'm CHOl Dong-sup.

129
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:03,533
She's not in.
Please step outside!

130
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,247
Who's that?

131
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:16,620
You don't need to know.

132
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,557
Tell your manager her sister's
husband is here to see her!

133
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,459
What's going on?
What is this all about?

134
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,197
- Wait. Don't do this.
- Hey, Seo Yu-na! This isn't funny at all.

135
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,698
- Please.
- Let's do business the safe way.

136
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:30,067
Shit, do you want your sister
to get in trouble?

137
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,670
Hey, you know what
your sister did to me?

138
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,139
I've been set up.
Set up real bad, you hear?

139
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,841
Let's call it a deal at 30 grand.

140
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,843
I'm a victim too, you know.

141
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:40,834
Take him outside!

142
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:57,519
Go change your suit.
I'll take it to your car.

143
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:41,427
Who's that?

144
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,334
Young-jun's step-mother.

145
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,036
Hello.

146
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,279
Hi, there.
Working so late?

147
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,919
What brings you here?

148
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,253
I was passing by and
saw the lights on.

149
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,654
Is he a new employee?

150
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,162
I'm from the construction company.

151
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:07,323
Is that right?

152
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,394
So-yeo, I'll talk to
you later then.

153
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,830
Right.

154
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,575
How's everything going?

155
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,181
Fine.

156
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,912
I'll be on my way then.

157
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,689
Leaving already?

158
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,225
Don't stay here till late at night.

159
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,386
Your husband won't like it.

160
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,862
I'll see you at
your father-in-law's birthday.

161
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:47,463
Take care.

162
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,094
It'll be okay.

163
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:18,128
Right. Nothing happened, really.

164
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,572
Let's go to Hong Kong.

165
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,404
Hong Kong?

166
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,216
It was great at Hong Kong, the two of us.

167
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,422
There's no one to recognize us...

168
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:44,824
Alright. I'm going to
Hong Kong right now!

169
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,482
Answer the phone, damn it!

170
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,097
So you're here to rake
in some cash?

171
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:33,637
You can't have it for free, though.

172
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,985
Call me.

173
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:53,089
Hey, Yu-na.

174
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,794
That's some pimp you have there.

175
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,015
What have you done?

176
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:12,750
No need to know.

177
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,615
Who do you think you are anyway?

178
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:16,979
Pretend you didn't see that.

179
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,553
Do you think I'm stupid?

180
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,422
Yeah.

181
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,228
Do I look pathetic to you?

182
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,697
Yeah. Pretty much.

183
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,250
I know you're crying
because you're flattered.

184
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,330
That'll be the last favor.

185
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:12,698
What do you mean?
It only has just started.

186
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:16,336
'Until we satisfy'.

187
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,541
There's nothing I can do
to return the favor.

188
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:23,217
Have I asked for anything?

189
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:29,388
You know... what I mean.

190
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:37,528
I can't leave my husband like this.

191
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:40,530
What about me?

192
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,938
You can't live without me?

193
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,678
No.

194
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:02,822
See what l mean?

195
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:08,292
Your husband will feel the same way.

196
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,364
You girls misjudge men.

197
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,666
Min-jae's not like you!

198
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:09,445
I really wanted to
flirt with you, Seo Yu-na...

199
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,561
Can I speak to Jung Min-jae?

200
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,203
I wish to thank him
for the arrangements.

201
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:39,540
Really?

202
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:47,245
Tell him to drop by
the members' lounge when he returns.

203
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,215
Or I'll go there to meet him.

204
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,149
All right. Thank you.

205
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:42,364
I'm telling you this
because I like So-yeo.

206
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,865
You've got to end this
sort of relationship.

207
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,727
Hmm. Right.

208
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,565
Did you make it out of the
ladies' room safely?

209
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,260
Of course.

210
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,570
What's that tone then?

211
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,605
Hmm?

212
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:23,436
You sound weary.

213
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:28,574
Must be a weak throat.

214
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:34,049
You shouldn't be calling...

215
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,576
With your husband around.

216
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:42,956
I've got something to do,
I won't be able to see you tonight.

217
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,792
Overtime work.

218
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:51,229
Let's talk Iater.

219
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:21,426
I thought you wouldn't pick up.

220
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,498
Should l hang up then?

221
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:28,737
That temper of yours...
Is everything aII right?

222
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:30,805
Yeah.

223
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:33,237
You alone?

224
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:40,916
Why should I be alone?
My husband's always by my side.

225
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:46,883
Like your wife is by your side,
Young-jun.

226
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:53,388
Thanks for reminding me.

227
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:59,436
I'll hang up since I've heard your voice.

228
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:00,801
Wait.

229
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,203
Don't eat by yourself!

230
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:10,739
Don't bother if you're not
going to eat with me.

231
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:13,576
Hang up.

232
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,621
There's a guest calling to order.

233
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:27,390
- Hey.
- Hey! You made it.

234
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,525
Hello!

235
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,015
Good to see you all.

236
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:34,063
So... Is everyone here?

237
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,458
We have an announcement to make.

238
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,531
We're getting married!

239
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:47,344
Who? You and me?

240
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:50,313
Right, I decided to let
you get married to me.

241
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:51,481
You should be proud!

242
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:54,177
Don't you think that's
a little too one-sided?

243
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:57,754
You're got the bar
and apartment mortgaged.

244
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,256
You need someone
to rescue your life.

245
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,858
Hey, you shouldn't believe entirely
what my father tells you.

246
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:06,930
Mi-sun, why get married
at the prime of life?

247
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,465
You've still got it all.

248
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:10,490
There's nothing to lose.

249
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,004
I would say the same
thing to Chul-ju.

250
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:16,564
There are younger girls
all over the place.

251
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:19,937
Not all men think like you do,
my dear.

252
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:23,041
Women these days aren't
like you either.

253
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,383
That's why I don't
bring her to gatherings.

254
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:28,749
Who made her come, anyway?

255
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,750
Stop toying with your cell phone.
What have you been doing?

256
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:36,659
What is it with you these days?

257
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,958
You're not like you used to be.

258
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,532
There are times, Yu-na.

259
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:45,262
Times? What times?

260
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,568
Forget it.

261
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,344
Something's strange today.

262
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:55,879
Should I have kept
the announcement for later?

263
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,414
It's not like we're
breaking up, you know.

264
00:30:57,414 --> 00:31:00,645
Damn, what is it with you people?

265
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:09,892
Yu-na.

266
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,387
Am I doing the right thing?

267
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:15,490
I don't know...

268
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:20,370
One thing I'm sure of is that
it becomes quite boring as you live along.

269
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,965
Hey there's no couple more into
each other than you guys.

270
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:29,103
I just had to make him mine
when I first met him.

271
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:33,580
I could feel the passion
when I saw his face.

272
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:35,546
And you don't feel that now?

273
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:41,351
If you feel that now, you're ill.

274
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:46,896
Nothing excites me anymore.

275
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,761
Stop that.

276
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,705
I can see that your relationship
has reached its peak.

277
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,366
Pretty much.

278
00:31:57,574 --> 00:31:59,769
What's up with you guys?

279
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:03,268
How are you guys?

280
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:08,852
Nothing has changed between us
after we got married.

281
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:10,615
Really?

282
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:13,248
I envy you guys.

283
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:16,623
I've never felt passionate
about him.

284
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,327
I'm beginning to like
this gathering!

285
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,499
Mr. Park.

286
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:28,529
What have you done to
make her say that?

287
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,067
Is not being passionat a bad thing?

288
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:36,439
There's no need to get all cold
if you're not passionate.

289
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,014
Jung Min-jae.
What is wrong with you?

290
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,504
Are you drunk?

291
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:42,941
I'm not saying that it's bad,
but it's not a good thing either.

292
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,282
What is this guy saying?

293
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,179
Min-jae!

294
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:51,286
Can I ask you something?

295
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,362
No, we'll talk later.

296
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:07,610
This is weird. Is there something
wrong with the drinks?

297
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,441
I'll go check.

298
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:12,048
Do we have bootlegs here?

299
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:14,243
Why does my stomach hurt?

300
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,255
Let's go home.

301
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:40,267
It looks original to me...

302
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:57,318
Why are you doing this to me?

303
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:01,161
The ladies' room is
on the opposite side.

304
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,592
I've never feared losing

305
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:10,797
what l have since
I started seeing you.

306
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,645
But it looks like you're
the one getting scared.

307
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,943
That's easy for you to say.

308
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:23,644
Is that because you're rich?

309
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,856
I haven't got much, and I've paid
a lot to earn what I have now.

310
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,724
That's why I'm scared
of losing them

311
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,130
I'm like that, you know.

312
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,405
I know you're doing
that on purpose

313
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:52,774
I'll wait at 'Beginning'.

314
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,814
Don't.

315
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,678
What are you doing?

316
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,813
Wait...

317
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:05,461
The toilet's blocked!

318
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:09,363
We get that often these days.
Use the one on the second floor.

319
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:33,956
Mi-sun, am I drunk?

320
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:36,584
You will be
if you drink at that rate.

321
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:40,256
Where's Min-jae?

322
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:43,089
How would I know?

323
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:45,062
I asked Yu-na.

324
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:53,466
You going?

325
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,921
I'm leaving too.

326
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:08,925
Yu-na. Sit here for a little while.
Mi-sun, talk to her!

327
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:09,792
Stay, Yu-na.

328
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,960
What's with you?

329
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,258
Sit down, girl!

330
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:18,601
Hey, let's have another drink.

331
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,037
Shit, I knew she wouldn't
listen to me.

332
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:23,801
Hey, forget it, I'm not getting
involved in this anymore!

333
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,308
Seo Yu-na!

334
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,548
Your husband...

335
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:47,521
If he says he'll be able to
live without you...

336
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,296
Can we make it happen?

337
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,668
Answer me.

338
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:02,069
No.

339
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:07,315
I can't live without him.

340
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:14,342
Chul-ju!

341
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,744
Hey.

342
00:38:15,952 --> 00:38:17,419
I want to ask for a favor.

343
00:38:20,656 --> 00:38:25,650
Min-jae must be
seeing someone else.

344
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,930
Talk him to end the relationship.

345
00:38:33,202 --> 00:38:37,002
I owe you one.
They're close friends of yours.

346
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:39,964
I'm leaving.

347
00:38:45,214 --> 00:38:48,081
Young-jun, hey!

348
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:53,021
Oh man...

349
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:15,174
Yu-na. What are you doing here?

350
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,075
Is that true?

351
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:26,717
What is?

352
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:36,261
About Min-jae seeing someone else.
Is that true?

353
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:42,995
Hey, Yu-na...

354
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:51,168
You should know better.
He can't live without you.

355
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:57,081
What do I do, Chul-ju?

356
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,414
What am I going to do?

357
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:52,196
Yu-na,

358
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,898
are you asleep?

359
00:42:19,128 --> 00:42:20,493
I'm sorry.

360
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,615
I'm sorry too.

361
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:49,384
What for?

362
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:57,359
About being all petty...

363
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:00,992
not giving you enough pocket money...

364
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:02,927
I'm sorry.

365
00:43:21,323 --> 00:43:22,722
Yu-na.

366
00:43:26,996 --> 00:43:29,658
We both know that we've
come this far

367
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:34,534
because of you.

368
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,572
Min-jae,

369
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:52,118
let's have a baby.

370
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,455
You wanted that, right?

371
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:07,666
Yu-na,

372
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:10,396
I've got something to tell you.

373
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,840
I must be drunk.

374
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,913
Let's talk later.

375
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:37,592
Will you...

376
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:44,136
...hit me, Yu-na?

377
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,888
Aren't you coming to bed?

378
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,395
I've got a question to ask you.

379
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,263
Am I...

380
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,667
...really that cold-hearted?

381
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:26,141
Yeah. You didn't know?

382
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:32,186
That's what makes you attractive.

383
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:35,517
That's what I fell for too.

384
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,570
Can I ask something too?

385
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:00,472
Was...

386
00:46:02,952 --> 00:46:04,351
I...

387
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:07,486
...a woman to you?

388
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:12,820
You're my wife.

389
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:23,962
But when you said
we were never passionate,

390
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:27,608
I realized that you were a woman.

391
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:36,216
When did you say you were
leaving for Hong Kong?

392
00:46:40,356 --> 00:46:41,957
Next weekend.

393
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:43,925
Should I go with you?

394
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:48,959
You're just saying that, right?

395
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:53,160
Yeah.

396
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,411
Oh, beautiful night.

397
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:05,614
- That was some wedding ceremony!
- Thank you.

398
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,983
- You look wonderful, dear!
- Thank you so much.

399
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:14,690
You guys still haven't left?

400
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,056
You really want to drink, huh?

401
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:19,361
Here, have a drink. Come on.

402
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,530
Right. l'd be glad to!

403
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,033
So, you've settled everything?

404
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:27,332
Yeah. It's not easy doing
a son's duty.

405
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,507
What's not easy?
You've got a beautiful wife!

406
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:35,910
Now that l see it,
I wish l could get married again.

407
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:40,337
You guys won't die
for each other, right?

408
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:42,206
Of course not.

409
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,611
No, not at all.

410
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:49,625
You won't feel like a victim, then.

411
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:52,492
So you won't have
to hate each other.

412
00:47:52,795 --> 00:47:56,458
felt like a victim
whenever he flirted.

413
00:47:56,598 --> 00:47:58,532
That's why I hate him.

414
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:03,702
I couldn't show that to my kids,

415
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:06,533
so now l've got
a lump on my chest.

416
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:09,577
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

417
00:48:10,446 --> 00:48:13,745
I couldn't bear watching you enjoy.

418
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:17,452
Man, this is why l didn't want
to bring her along.

419
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,424
Sir, don't live like that,
damn it.

420
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:23,584
What?

421
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:25,861
You really like the young ones,
don't you?

422
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,089
What's wrong with you?

423
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:29,098
Chul-ju!

424
00:48:29,098 --> 00:48:33,502
Let's exchange partners if you're
so much into young girls.

425
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:34,436
What did you say?

426
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:35,270
Hey.

427
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,539
Everyone's changing partners,

428
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,200
So why not us?

429
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,376
Why you son of a...

430
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,539
Alright. Let's do it!

431
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,510
Are you drunk?

432
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,683
What's wrong with that?

433
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:51,854
You're doing it,
so why can't I do the same?

434
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:54,389
Hey, Chul-ju's drunk.
Take him to the hotel.

435
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,023
Let's go!

436
00:48:55,023 --> 00:48:57,048
Hey, cut the crap.

437
00:48:58,026 --> 00:49:00,662
I'll help you guys out, too.

438
00:49:00,662 --> 00:49:03,866
I can't stand you guys
sulk any longer.

439
00:49:03,866 --> 00:49:07,002
So I'll settle everything for you!

440
00:49:07,002 --> 00:49:09,938
You know how?
I've got the solution right here.

441
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:11,340
Stop it. Are you crazy?

442
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,475
Yeah, I'm crazy.
You see, l had to pretend to

443
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:15,744
be naive all along,
that must've made me go mad.

444
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,379
I'm crazy. So what?

445
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:19,281
- Hey, Kang Chul-ju!
- Sir, sir!

446
00:49:19,281 --> 00:49:21,049
We should swap too.
You like younger girls, right?

447
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:23,452
No, to think of it...

448
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:28,924
Let's all swap here. Okay?

449
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,293
Come here,
you little piece of shit!

450
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:33,955
- Settle down.
- Flirt, flirt!

451
00:49:35,164 --> 00:49:37,428
I'm not marrying
a madman like that.

452
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,429
Well thought, Mi-sun!

453
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,340
Look at these guys over here...

454
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,110
They meet. They get bored.

455
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,512
So they look for someone else.

456
00:49:50,512 --> 00:49:53,615
Min-jae here likes So-yeo...

457
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,485
And Young-jun here,
worries about Yu-na.

458
00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:59,755
Bastard. l'm getting rid of
this ring right now!

459
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:02,424
Mi-sun. Mi-sun!
Don't do this!

460
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:03,926
- Let go!
- He's drunk, Mi-sun.

461
00:50:03,926 --> 00:50:05,018
l said, let go!

462
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,627
Oh no!

463
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:55,163
Chul-jung's father passed away.

464
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:06,006
Yeah, I should go.

465
00:52:07,382 --> 00:52:09,043
Want me to pick you up?

466
00:52:21,863 --> 00:52:27,358
May Damiano KANG rest
in eternal peace.

467
00:52:27,536 --> 00:52:32,496
Lord, hear our prayer.

468
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:38,914
May the Lord's words pass upon generations
to come,

469
00:52:38,914 --> 00:52:41,576
these are the words of the gospel.

470
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:49,884
How's your sister doing?

471
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:53,658
Is she preparing for the wedding?

472
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:58,661
I don't know why she's
getting married again.

473
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:02,498
She should be happy now.

474
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,497
That's funny.

475
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,175
Who says marriage
guarantees happiness?

476
00:53:11,513 --> 00:53:14,414
Was I happy before?

477
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,948
I don't even remember.

478
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,719
You can be mad about me, Yu-na.

479
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:26,719
But don't erase
all the good memories.

480
00:53:40,776 --> 00:53:44,507
Do you still eat by yourself?

481
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:48,706
Yeah. I'm a loner.

482
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,050
I'm curious.

483
00:53:55,991 --> 00:54:00,792
Why did you marry me?

484
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,500
I went to the construction site

485
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:18,279
and saw a girl on a suit
wearing a helmet.

486
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:23,251
You usually don't wear helmets
because it ruins your suit.

487
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:28,154
But this girl had a helmet on.

488
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,259
I wanted to find out
more about her.

489
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:39,224
So you came to see me
before the actual meeting?

490
00:54:40,001 --> 00:54:41,161
Yeah.

491
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:51,909
So... We didn't start out
that bad either.

492
00:54:56,184 --> 00:54:59,381
My car's over there.

493
00:55:00,388 --> 00:55:02,057
Take care.

494
00:55:02,057 --> 00:55:03,354
Bye.

495
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:11,456
Bye.

496
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,596
See you guys later.

497
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:20,709
Bye.

498
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:22,267
Bye.

499
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,283
You lost your way on purpose
in Hong Kong, right?

500
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,816
What?

501
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,588
You were teasing me,
weren't you?

502
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:19,768
Who talked to me
about the full moon?

503
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:23,932
You're the one that called it
a lame secret.

504
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:30,809
I'm going to Hong Kong next month.

505
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:35,245
Lucky you.

506
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:41,378
Garupa and Mantis shrimp,
remember all that?

507
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:48,422
I'll think about it.

508
00:56:49,598 --> 00:56:51,862
Who said l was taking you?
